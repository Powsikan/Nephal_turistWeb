		Containing nine of the world's fourteen highest mountain peaks, Nepal is a true Himalayan
kingdom. The Himalayas cover three fourths of the land in Nepal. It is home to some of the
highest, remotest, and most rugged and most difficult terrain in the world. The loftiest peak in the
world Mount Everest and other high peaks like Lhotse, Nuptse, Annapurna, Dhaulagiri and
Manaslu, plus the presence of some exquisitely beautiful trekking routes, attract hundreds of
thousands of people from all over the world to this lovely Himalayan destination. Sunset at

towards the southwest. Along the north of Nepal runs the Great Himalayan Range, the highest
mountain range in the Himalayan system.</p>

magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha, the others being
at Kushinagar, Bodh Gaya and Sarnath.Lumbini was where the Buddha lived until the age of 29.
Lumbini has a number of temples, including the Mayadevi temple and others under construction.

	<p><img width="120" hight="100" align="left" src="../images/Kathmandu.jpg" alt="kathmandu" >The Kathmandu Valley, located in Nepal, lies at the crossroads of ancient civilizations of Asia,
and has at least 130 important monuments, including several places of pilgrimage for the Hindus
and the Buddhists. There are seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites within this valley.
Historically, only the Kathmandu Valley was referred to as "Nepal" by people who lived outside
the valley. After the annexation of the valley by the Gorkha kingdom, and subsequent conversion
of the valley as the capital of their empire, this designation of "Nepal" was extended to every land
they conquered. The valley itself was referred to as "Nepal Proper" by British historians.The
Kathmandu Valley may have been inhabited as early as 300 BCE.</p>
